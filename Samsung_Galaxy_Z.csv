"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold2 5G Mystic Bronze, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage",Excellent Phone and you pay for the excellence,5,"Great Premium Phone. The concept is great and it is a huge improvement over Fold1.Some Cons/shortcomings - Storage should have been 512GB, No Micro SD Card, should have got free Buds as being given in western countries, feels a bit heavier, no S Pen."
"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold2 5G Mystic Bronze, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage",The best alternative to life,5,"For 1.5 lac rupees I could have booked a flight to travel to the relatives house and talk with them,for the same amount I could have bought a scooty and visited the near and dear ones to communicate,and could watch movies in theatres with the money to spare. since this covid has not allowed to do all that ,I am grateful for Samsung to launch such phone so that I can experience the movies the chats without the need to step outside.only downside is now o don't have money to eat.but I love the amoled"
"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold2 5G Mystic Bronze, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage",Completely changes your experience while using a phone,5,"I have been a long time iphone user, but due to the delay in this year's iphone 12 launch and the innovation shown by Samsung with this phone, I made the jump to the Fold 2 this time. I must say that the premium build, large screen and awesome camera has made it truly worth it. Kudos to Samsung for the competitive pricing as well, was expecting this to be launched at ~1.7-1.8 Lakhs. Wherever I take this phone, this turns heads for sure. The large OLED screen is perfect for watching content and it supports HDR on netflix as well. Overall, an awesome product and am loving it!"

"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold2 5G Mystic Bronze, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage",Excellent phone well worth the price,5,"This phone does pretty well to justify its pricetag. The display, cameras, build quality, it's all great.Though there is currently a lack of proper cases for it. That is necessary given how expensive this is."

"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold2 5G Mystic Bronze, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage",Clunky. POOR TOUCH RESPONSE needs heavy taps. Second screen is OBSCENELY NARROW,1,"Except satisfying one's vanity, this phone is UNUSABLE in facility, highly DROPPABLE, CLUNKY.A White Elephant. The unfolded quality DISPLAY is the saving grace...Please list your scenarios of usage before sinking your money here.And I am a Galaxy fan and users incentive, since the S7 stole the show in Barcelona with its ALWAYS ON display."

"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold2 5G Mystic Bronze, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage",First review - Feels premium but over priced,4,First review after using the phone for 2 to 3 hours:Very excited to use the phone and eager how it looks till I get the phone from the time of order.Pros:If you are gamer then you will enjoy the big screen and resolution.Both the Cameras are just awesome ( best in market)Looks and feels premium when you hold it in your handComes with dual battery which last for 2 days for heavy usersPerformance of the phone is expected to be great due to its price and is up to mark till now.Comes with 25w charger and supports wireless charging.Cons:Main problem to buy the phone is its price.. which I feel it's over priced.Feels bit heavier.As I like using slim phones.. felt bit uncomfortable in holding the phone.Nothing much different from other samsung phones.. only the fold is exciting.Overall rating considering the price and specification of the product: 3/5.
"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold2 5G Mystic Bronze, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage",Great Device for Multitasking & Binge Watching....,5,"After a few days usage I must say, shockingly great device.Call, sms, WhatsApp, facebook, office, pdf do whatever... At the ease of this device.ONLY THING YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THE MIDDLE SCREEN... THE FOLDABLE SCREEN.Snapdragon 865+,12GB RAM, 256GB ROM, 4500 BATTERY, SAMSUNG PAY!!!You name it, Samsung has given it!"
"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold2 5G Mystic Bronze, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage",They are selling it for a higher price and without accessories,3,"The phone is fine. Except a bit small to type with closed screen and a bit large to type with open screen. What is unfair is that you can get this phone for INR 140, 000 with watch and headphones in the market. they are selling it for INR 150, 000 without headphone and the watch. What kind of system is that? Where is my watch and headphones????"
"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold2 5G Mystic Bronze, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage",Not easy to hold not comfortable in operation.,3,It's not easy to carry  And operate .front screen is small. Not fit for insurance
"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold2 5G Mystic Bronze, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage",Samsung's best yet! The future is bright for foldable technology,5,"Samsung delivers again with their newest flagship in foldable smartphones. The Galaxy Fold 2 has fixed perhaps a lot of the pressing issues with the Fold 1 and made it faster and better.The hinge is perhaps the most important piece of any foldable tech and Samsung definitely delivers in this regard. Initially I was very worried about opening and closing my phone but the transition is pretty smooth and within five minutes of holding this device you will get used it it. (Tip: Don't press the screen when folding but using the bottom-middle area of the hinge and fold your phone it will protect the screen longer)Whilst many people have concerns with the durability of the phone, I have already dropped it twice (both when it was closed thankfully) and so far it has survived but I don't recommend you doing it.Performance is excellent with 12 gigs of ram, latest processor from snapdragon and am excellent GPU. Games and applications run smoothly without any lag. Sound is excellent with dual speakers! Multiple apps can also run simultaneously without issues. Recommend getting the goodlock app to unlock several features of the phone and customize them further.Price is sadly very very steep though I couldn't resist and bought it anyway but I feel like it should have atleast provided the galaxy buds live or pro along with the phone. But at least you do get the wired AKG earbuds which are excellent. No case is provided which is another downer. Samsung if you are selling a phone at a premium price you should atleast provide a premium accessory!Overall I'm definitely loving this phone."
"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold2 5G Mystic Bronze, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage",Great phone. Needs time to get used to.,5,Pros : large screen is Great for movies and official mails. Head turner when you open it in front of others. Loud speakers and awesome speed.Cons : Messaging keypad is too small when closed and too large when opened. Opening needs to be simplified. If it falls you are done with 1.5 lacs. This price would get you 2 high end Models of Microsoft surface pro with all accessories.
"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold2 5G Mystic Bronze, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage",over heating issues and low battery back up,1,over heating issues and low battery back up.
"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold2 5G Mystic Bronze, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage",No regrets,4,"I was so skeptical before buying this since I couldn't try this in person in any of the physical shops. After changing phones for many years, never found a big jump in usage. This phone was a big leap. Only disadvantage is that it's a bit heavy to use. Other than that I don't have any issues. Looking forward for future fold 3 as well"
"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold2 5G Mystic Bronze, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage","Good phone. Could have been better with software, accessories and exclusivity.",4,"Review after first few days of use.Camera par excellence. Folda le screen AWESOME. Multimedia experience super.Backup from old pnone(1+) not so easy.Android system- average customization could have been friendlierAccessories- freebies given are not great. Cabled data transfer was very poor.I bought buds which are AWESOME.Samsung should provide buds and wireless charger, case for free."
"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold2 5G Mystic Bronze, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage",Amazing Phone !,5,"Amazing phone. Just wish it was not so heavy. Great buy, Super delivery by Amazon.Update after 10 days of usage :Simply superb performance. You can fill the video to full screen by just zooming with your fingers. Audio is excellent and the AKG headphones are brilliant as well. Just wish it was not this heavy. Its Ok and manageable though."
"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold2 5G Mystic Bronze, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage",Worth the price,5,"Good battery life , it’s a good phone and a great tablet ! I finished three books since I brought it . Email interface is good as well . Samsung has to come out with a good cover for this phone . What is being sold for 5999 is not good enough for the most expensive phone . But I will give it 5 stars for its functionality"

"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold2 5G Mystic Bronze, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage","Beauty Outside, Beast Inside.",5,Amazing Smartphone. Just Awesome. Nice Battery backup. Camera and Display is just mind blowing. You guys should go for this.
"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold2 5G Mystic Bronze, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage",The folding beauty.,5,"Once you hold this in your hand, believe me a regular slab phone will feel like a monolith. I went to Samsung Cafe to purchase the S21 Ultra but the demo piece of this one changed my mind in a second. Upon using for a week, the inner screen does not feel as fragile as I had expected. Stopped babying this one.However, one problem that you may have is getting a case for this one. Most cases don't fit properly and the ones that do change it from a sleek beauty to a literal brick. So case lovers stay away.Overall, the performance and battery life has been exceptional. The cover screen feels like an elongated IPhone 5s, quite useful for quick tasks.  I own a Tab S7+ and really don't feel like using that nowadays. If you have the cash to afford this one, go spoil yourself right away."
"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold2 5G Mystic Bronze, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage",Wow! Pricing from Samsung exceptional mobile,3,"Finally a flagship Qualcomm processor in samsung mobile,great👏👏👏 sd 865+ at a price tag of 1 human kidney Excellent mobile(1.5 lacs)."

"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold2 5G Mystic Bronze, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage",Samsung Z Fold 2 is all things big & beautiful!,5,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   At the start, let me say that I am a 'regular' use of a smartphone - I want my screen bright, fast, responsive, good camera, good network latching services, great battery et, - so I don't care if the screen, for example,  is AMOLED or whatever, if it is big & beautiful, here's my money. I don't do professional photography with my smartphones but do expect them to have fabulous cameras when I cannot lug my Panasonic out!Anyway, my husband gifted me the Samsung Z Fold 2 (256 GB) in Mystic Bronze for my birthday this Jan. I was quite happy with my OnePlus 6T that had an amazing camera and all the other features. However, the Samsung Z Fold 2 is one of those gadgets that you didn't even know you needed till you get your hands on one. It's a true marvel of technology! I am treating it gingerly that I still haven't installed my SIM card in it - it's like a new friend, and we are just getting to know each other.Here's what I LOVE about it:1. I think I'm going to go back to reading! E-reading apps like Kindle and Aldiko look great and the dual screen is almost the same size as the physical Kindle.2. Multi-tasking rocks and is so so easy to master. I opened up an e-book on one window and the other window I opened up Goodreads on Google to read the book reviews. I can see myself doing that for news, dictionaries, etc of even reading product reviews on one window and shopping online on the other.3. Good cameras - many of them! Selfie mode with rear cameras is a cool thing.What I DON'T LIKE1. The wires earphones that come with the phone seem a little tacky.. for the price they charge, they could have added Samsung Buds or some wireless option.2. There is no case so I had to buy the Spigen case in Mystic Bronze for added protection.The bigger screen definitely needs some getting used to... Some may say that the front screen is to narrow and the unfolded screen is too wide! However, it's a true joy to watch video and multimedia with Fold 2."
"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold2 5G Mystic Bronze, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage","No second thought if your budget permits, just go for it...",5,"I used to think that why should someone spend such a huge amount for a phone.  But then I realized, we are spending most of our time on phone for various tasks. Using super speed phones not only improve your productivity, but it also gives you confidence.I was using Moto G5 plus for last 4 years.  Phone was decent, but it started getting hung when I used multiple apps. Then, I took risk and went for Fold 2. Believe me, this is the best phone with almost all the features. Phone is designed so smartly and this feature of using tab and phone simultaneously is really very useful. There is no problem of hung phone, slow speed etc. Overall, a must buy if your budget permits.And yes, it stands you out from the crowd. Whenever you open it, believe me, almost everyone will start asking you about this phone."
